The Grove - Human Presence Sensor can be used to detect the presence of the human body or any other infrared objects. Moreover, it is composed of four quantum IR sensors and an integrated circuit (IC) for characteristic compensation, so it can be used to detect the motion of the IR object and the relative position where the IR object moves. An integral analog-to-digital converter provides 16-bits data outputs. This module is suitable for several feet human detector.

ESP32 is a series of low-cost, low-power system-on-chip microcontrollers with integrated Wi-Fi and dual-mode Bluetooth. The ESP32 series employs either a Tensilica Xtensa LX6 microprocessor in both dual-core and single-core variations, an Xtensa LX7 dual-core microprocessor, or a single-core RISC-V microprocessor and includes built-in antenna switches, RF balun, power amplifier, low-noise receive amplifier, filters, and power-management modules. It is commonly found either on device-specific PCBs or on a range of development boards with GPIO pins and various connectors depending on the model and manufacturer of the board.


skillz U need:
understanding how PIRs are wiorking normally
how to use the Homekit characters & services in a compliant way

starting with understanding how the sensor is working
